# DigitalFenceApp
Digital Fence app. 

Initially done Feb 2015. 

Student app I did at turn to tech. Explored restAPI, Mapkit, and CLLocation.

Parent app allows you to set up a "digital fence" with a certain radius centered on a longitude and latitude points given by the user.Once the child app is activated by using the same username used in the parent app it continuously logs its coordinates to server. The parent app can then check if the child app's coordinates are in the "digital fence" zone or not.
